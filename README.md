# Star Wars: Edge of the Empire NPC Sheet

A more automagic, information-dense NPC Sheet built in Scribus and intended for Adobe Reader.

## Download

You can view or download the sheet at [this link](https://github.com/citizenparker/EotE-NPC-Sheet/raw/master/NPC%20Sheet.pdf). This sheet has a few bels and whistles around automatically loading die rolls that aren't guaranteed to work anywhere but Adobe Reader. This sheet will not work in Chrome or OSX's Preview (although once edited, it can be printed from either).

## Sizing

The NPC sheet is deliberately a little small by default. I like as little paper at the table as possible and print 2 of these to a page. These half-sheets fit perfectly in an [Avery Mini Binder](http://www.avery.com/avery/en_us/Products/Binders/Durable-Binders/Protect-and-Store-View-Binders_23011.htm)
